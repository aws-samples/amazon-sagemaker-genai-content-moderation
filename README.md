# Build a generative AI based content moderation solution on Amazon SageMaker

### Update
We added [Qwen-VL](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-VL?tab=readme-ov-file) as VQA model. Check [qwen-sagemaker.ipynb](./qwen-sagemaker.ipynb) to see how to deploy a Qwen-VL model endpoint on SageMaker.

We use [BLIP2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12597) as the multimodal pre-training method. BLIP2 is one of the SOTA models in multimodal pre-training method, and outperforms most of the existing methods in Visual Question Answering, Image Captioning and Image-Text Retrieval. For LLM, we will use [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/).

The overall solution illustration and architecture is demonstrated below
